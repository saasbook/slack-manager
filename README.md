  - Configurable questions.
  - Works with multiple channels.

### Create your Slack bot.

  - First make a bot integration inside of your Slack channel. Go here: `https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot`
  - Enter a name for your bot. Make it something fun and friendly, but avoid a single task specific name. Bots can do lots! Let's not pigeonhole them.
  - When you click "Add Bot Integration", you are taken to a page where you can add additional details about your bot, like an avatar, as well as customize its name & description.

Copy the API token that Slack gives you. You'll need it in the next step.

### Installation

Clone the repository by:
```
git clone https://github.com/anonrig/slack-manager
```

Install from NPM
```
npm install slack-manager --save
```

Create your settings file.

```
touch config/production.json
```

Mailer service uses nodemailer's transport methods. Therefore, for better understanding please read nodemailer's [available transports ](https://github.com/andris9/Nodemailer#available-transports).

For example for Gmail settings: change your settings file by:
```
{
    "token": "YOUR SLACK TOKEN HERE",
    "mailer": {
        "service": "Gmail",
        "email": "email@address.com",
        "pass": "mySuperFancyPassword"
    }
}
```

Configure your questions

Open default.json and add a questions field shown below.

slack-manager lets users to ask different questions to different channels. If you prefer a single question list
then you will only need the default field of the questions object. If you want to ask different questions to different channels
then you will need to add additional fields to the questions object. Fields of the questions object must be the names of the
corresponding channels.

Note: If no questions that has the same name as the channel found then the default list will be asked.

```
"questions": {
    "default": [
        "What did you do yesterday?",
        "What are you going to do today?",
        "Did you encounter any problems?"
    ],
    "CHANNEL-NAME": [
        "How do you feel?"
    ],
    "ANOTHER-CHANNEL-NAME": [
        "Another question?",
        "Perhaps more?"
    ]
}
```
